- 👋 Hi, I’m @CitsEdgars - a humble student from Latvia :)
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in applied mathematics in general, but more specifically: 
- cyptography public-private key, EC, etc.;
- fast algorithms;
- efficient algorithms;
- data driven action (machine learning, statistics, pattern recognition;
- computer vision, 3D modelling.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying in CS master's program with additional focus on:
- fast algorithms;
- efficient data structures;
- machine learning, statistics and big data;
- cryptography;
- quantum computers and quantum algorithms;
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the previously mentioned fields. 
- I believe in giving back to the community through public projects and libraries.
- A lot of the best tools are free and community created. :)
- 
- A lot of the stuff I upload here are some minor university projects and personal 
- projects that are mostly done for fun and/or self-education/training purposes
